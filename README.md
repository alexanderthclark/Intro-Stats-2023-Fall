# Intro-Stats-2023-Fall

This is mostly non-student-facing material I use to make other student-facing material.

Some components include

* Colab notebooks - these use ipywidgets and the code is hidden so that students can use them as a point-and-click tool.
* Data - scripts for pulling data from the web
* Notes - tex projects for selected course material
